Malware Behavior Analysis using Sequential Pattern Mining

In the datasets folder:

"ALLMalwareAPISequenes" contains the API calls sequences for all malwares

"alldataset1000sequences" contins the first 1000 API calls from the ALLMalwareAPISequenes file

"APICalls1000Sequences" contins the first 1000 API calls from the ALLMalwareAPISequenes file in SPMF format

"Malware types dataset" contains the API calls for each malware

"Malware types in SPMF" contains the API calls in SPMF Format for each malware

The Python script computes the  the minimum length, maximum length and average sequence length of API calls sequences in each malware type.
